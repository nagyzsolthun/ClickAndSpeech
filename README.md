# click2speech
Chrome and Firefox extension to help the visually impaired and those with dyslexia. Click on a text and click2speech reads it out to you.

## no voice available
Potential fixes:
1. voices can be installed for Chrome, e.g. [US English voice from Google](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/us-english-female-text-to/pkidpnnapnfgjhfhkpmjpbckkbaodldb) (seem to be Windows only)
1. if using Linux, try Firefox instead of Chromium. Firefox supports `espeak` if installed.

## local execution
- `build.sh` builds the extension
- `npm start` in `chrome/options` starts the dev version of the options page
